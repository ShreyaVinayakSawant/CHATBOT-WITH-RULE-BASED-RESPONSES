# CHATBOT-WITH-RULE-BASED-RESPONSES

Project Description:
Iâ€™ve developed a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. This task has been a great introduction to handling user input and crafting structured responses.

Working Flow:
User Input: The user types a query or statement.
Lowercase Conversion: Converts the input to lowercase for consistent matching.
Pattern Matching: Evaluates the input against predefined rules using if-else statements.
Generate Response: Creates responses based on matched rules, such as greetings, jokes, and time inquiries.
Text-to-Speech Conversion: Uses gTTS to convert text responses to speech.
Audio Playback: Plays back the generated speech to the user.
Continuous Interaction: Continues to interact with the user until 'exit' is typed.

Project Highlights:
Rule-Based Logic: Handles user queries with if-else statements and pattern matching.
Speech Integration: Incorporates gTTS for text-to-speech functionality.
Dynamic Responses: Manages various types of queries, including greetings and jokes.
User Interaction: Provides an interactive chat experience.

Learning Outcomes:
Acquired skills in implementing rule-based systems for chatbots.
Gained experience in basic NLP techniques and user interaction.
Learned to integrate speech synthesis for a more engaging user experience.
Improved understanding of interactive programming through real-time feedback.
